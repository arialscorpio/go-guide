# Go Guide
### Best Practices
* Make dependencies explicit by passing them as parameters.

#### Type Assertion
```
x.(T)
```
The above expression states that 
1. the interface type variable `x` is not `nil`.
2. the value stored in `x` is of type `T`.

## Go Commands
### go get
Updates dependencies of current module, i.e. `go.mod`.
- Takes one or more package or module paths as arguments.
- Resolves package to a module at a specific version.
- Updates module version in `go.mod`.
- Downloads module source code into the module cache.
- Dependencies are resolved recursively.
- Modules are only downloaded, but not build.
- No error is reported if updated package canâ€™t be built for the current platform.

#### Add or upgrade a dependency to its latest version
```
go get github.com/some/pkg
```

#### Upgrade or downgrade a dependency to a specific version
```
go get github.com/some/pkg@v1.2.3
```

#### Remove a dependency
```
go get github.com/me/mod@none
```

### go install
- Builds and installs packages.
- ALL packages must refer to the main packages.
- Executables are installed to the directory specified in `GOBIN` env. variable (by default set to `GOPATH/bin`).
- Given an explicit package version ignores the `go.mod` file in current or parent directory. No changes are made to `go.mod` file. It's useful for installing executables without affecting the dependencies of the main module.
  ```
  go install github.com/me/dummy@v1.2.0
  ```
- Without an explicit version uses the version selected by the module in the current directory.
  ```
  go install github.com/me/dummy
  ```

### RoundTripper
- Interface in `http` package to execute one single HTTP transaction, i.e. sending a request and returning corresponding response.
  ```
  type RoundTripper interface {
      RoundTrip(*Request) (*Response, error)
  }
  ```
  
**Applications**
- Set authorization headers in request
- Logging (request URL, response status, time taken etc.)

### ReadResponse
- Builds and returns an HTTP response with the body read from the given `r` parameter.
  ```
  fund ReadResponse(r *bufio.Reader, req *Request) (*Response, error)
  ```
  `req` parameter, if provided, is set as the related request in the returned response.
